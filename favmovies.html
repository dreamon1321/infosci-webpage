        <p>Inception is a combo of sci-fi, action, and thriller that is
            beautifully directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie's
            cinematography and special effects are jaw-dropping, and Inception
            was the first of its kind to push the boundaries of plot complexity
            and physical effects. To top it off, the star-studded cast act with
            incredible expression and deliberation, and the scores of Hans
            Zimmer level Inception to a whole new depth. It's truly a
            one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.</p>
        <p>The plot of Inception revolves around the concept of implanting
            true inspiration into someone's mind. The main character, Dom
            Cobb, is able to enter people's dreams and specializes in
            stealing their secrets. In order to return home, Cobb and his
            team must perform inception on an executive, effectively
            convincing him to give up his corporation. Danger lies in
            performing inception, and if they fail, they risk their minds
            being lost in the dream world indefinitely -- they won't wake up.</p>

      <div id="tabs-2">
        <p>The Dark Knight is a combo of thriller and action that is also
            directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie's dark themes and plotline
            are heavily nuanced and thematic, and bring Batman to a new level
            of darkness. Heath Ledger, the Joker, is the acting prodigy of this
            movie, perhaps inspired by dark thoughts of his own -- or vice
            versa. Hans Zimmer's masterpieces are featured, and darken the
            movie even further.</p>
        <p>The plot of The Dark Knight revolves around the Batman attempting
            to end the atrocities committed in Gotham by the Joker, all the
            while battling with public perception of the Batman's role in
            justice and crime. Batman, aka Bruce Wayne, risks losing himself
            in the battle over Gotham, and also risks losing the ones he
            loves. Will the Batman or the Joker win, and at what cost?

      <div id="tabs-3">
        <p>Interstellar is a surprisingly scientifically accurate story of
            sci-fi, familial love, and suspense. This movie is also directed
            by Christopher Nolan and features Hans Zimmer's music (see a
            theme?). This movie makes each viewer question their perception of
            time, and causes the viewer to feel a wide range of emotion as the
            plot progresses. Simply put, seeing Matthew McConaughey cry will
            make you cry.
            </p>
        <p>The plot of Interstellar revolves around a dystopian Earth,
            where food is a scarcity and the air is becoming unbreathable.
            The only option left is to leave Earth and find another planet,
            and Cooper steps up to this challenge -- at a price. His journey
            will take him far from his family, and for an indefinite period of
            time, ranging from a couple years to decades. But it's necessary
            to save his children and all the people of Earth. What will he find?

      <div id="tabs-4">
        <p>The Grand Budapest Hotel is a combo of comedy and mystery, draped
            with an atmosphere of whimsicality. The music score is equally
            whimsical, and the cinematography is both simple and unique. This is
            definitely one movie you will never forget, either because of its
            quirkiness, because of its endearing plotline, or both. The color
            themes and visuals will transport you to a whole other world.
            </p>
        <p>The plot of The Grand Budapest Hotel revolves around the mysterious
            death of a wealthy old woman, who has left a most treasured art
            piece to the owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, Gustave. With the
            help of his lobby boy, Zero, Gustave sets out to solve the mystery
            of the murder -- before her money-grabbing family gets to them
            first. The pair go on a fantastic journey and bond through their
            similarites and adventures.
