    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my Dream Website! This site will be about me,
        myself, and I. You can find a ton of info about me here without having
        to go through Cambridge Analytica or Facebook, so you're welcome.
        I'm an undergraduate student at the
        University of Pittsburgh, double-majoring in
        Computer Science and Information Science.
        I'm currently embarking on an internship search, and taking 2 CS classes this semester! I'm also currently employed, so
        I'm not totally broke. I'd love to explore the intersection between technology and the rest of the world, and I hope to apply my past
        research and experience to a workplace environment!</p>

    <h1>Interests</h1>
    <p>My interest in astronomy started when I was even tinier
        than I currently am. The concept of space terrified me,
        but the beauty of it would grow on me for the next
        decade. Once I landed my first research gig, I also
        realized how much coding was involved with astronomy.
        I decided to take a python class in my first semester
        here at Pitt, and I loved it enough that I wanted it to
        be my second major -- I also figured it'd make me a bit
        more marketable in case astronomy fails to make me bank.</p>
    <p>Outside of my academics, I love watching Netflix and reading food articles. Actually, in case STEM really doesn't pan out for me, I think food blogging is a solid backup. But I'm not a total potato; I also love to play tennis, but alas, Pittsburgh isn't the best city for the sport...though it is good for my dedication to theSteelers! Baking is a hobby of mine, too, and I've gotten a little better at cooking actual food.</p>
